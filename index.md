# Welcome to Full Stack Embedded
We've got a mission and we won't stop till we drop.

By the way, we still need a logo! Hot damn. We could use that the footer, and
link to somewhere cooler - perhaps GitHub for now, but at some later date maybe
the project report from IoG, if we decide to go with IoG? Weight and sea.
