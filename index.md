# The vision
Technology can work wonders. It can save lives or make them easier. It can give
people opportunities that they otherwise wouldn't have. It can help preserve
the environment. Some day, mankind will reach for the stars and they will grasp
them using technology.

For more than a century, technology has mostly trickled from developed to less
developed countries. It's been used to solve many problems there. At the same
time, though, there are many problems that couldn't be solved using only
technology. Sometimes solutions have been imported into developing countries
that weren't even needed. A consistent trend has been that the people of
developing countries - especially young people - have had few opportunities to
improve their own lives and those of the people around them, due to lacking
funds, lacking education and lacking materials.

## The times, they are a-changing
The times are changing, though. [According to the United Nations Population
Fund,](http://www.unfpa.org/resources/state-world-population-2014-press-summary)
there has never been a time when the world has had so many young people. There
will probably never be a time when the world has so many people of working age
able to devote their time and energy to inventing, developing and expanding our
society's resources. Around 9 out of every 10 young people lives in a
developing country right now. These people need and deserve the ability to
improve their own lives, in their own way.

## The world needs smart minds
This idea isn't based on good will or idealism alone. Mankind is approaching
the largest midst of the largest crisis it has ever seen. Resources are
limited. Poverty is widespread. The environment is degrading. There are more
mouths to feed than ever before. If we want to overcome these problems as a
species, we need as many ideas and inventions as we can get - and most of the
world's brightest minds are in developing countries, waiting for the
opportunity to realize their dreams. Educating them and getting them networked
with each other will unlock the answers to pressing problems and questions that
haven't even been asked yet.

## Embedded: the game-changing new kid on the block
You used to have to build a chip to do what you wanted. Now you take a single
chip and do whatever you want wih it. You're more flexible.

## Full stack: going the whole nine yards

# What we do
# A network of chapters

# Some drivel
We've got a mission and we won't stop till we drop.

By the way, we still need a logo! Hot damn. We could use that the footer, and
link to somewhere cooler - perhaps GitHub for now, but at some later date maybe
the project report from IoG, if we decide to go with IoG? Weight and sea.

# This is a second heading
If suddenly my JS works, I'll be a bit upset.
